* Clojure Exchange Lisp

This is a Lisp, written in JavaScript, for my Clojure Exchange 2013
presentation: [[http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/java-jee/the-most-fundamental-idea-in-programming][The Most Fundamental Idea In Programming.]]

All the really interesting stuff is in =src/evaluator.js=, so look there
if you want something to read.

To try it out, call:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install
grunt
node lib/jrepl.js
#+END_SRC
